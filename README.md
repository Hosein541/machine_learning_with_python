# Project 
# [Titanic Survival Prediction](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name)

## Description
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features such as passenger age, gender, ticket class, and more. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict whether a passenger survived the tragic sinking of the Titanic.

## Technologies Used
This project employs ensemble learning techniques to improve prediction accuracy. Specifically, we use the following models:
- **XGBoost Classifier**: An optimized gradient boosting library designed for performance and speed.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: A versatile ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and outputs the mode of the classes.

## Results
The ensemble approach combining XGBoost and Random Forest classifiers achieved an accuracy score of **89%**, demonstrating the effectiveness of using multiple models to enhance predictive performance.
